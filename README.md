# Introduction

The term propagation is applied to a signal when we want to explain how radio waves behave when they are transmitted or propagated from one point to another. We understand, therefore, that the propagation mechanism establishes how the signal propagates, taking into account the effects of reflection, scattering and diffraction.
We speak of reflection when the transmitted wave collides with an object larger than its wavelength, as would be the case of the walls of a building. Some of these waves will be absorbed and the remaining energy will be reflected back to the medium.  The energy of the transmitted and reflected waves follows a function dependent on the geometry and material properties of the obstruction and the amplitude, phase and polarization of the incident wave. Scattering occurs when the transmitted wave encounters a large number of small dimensional objects, such as light poles, bushes and trees. The reflected energy in a scattering situation is dispersed in all directions before reaching the receiver. Diffraction occurs when the surface of the obstruction has sharp edges that produce secondary waves that, in effect, bend around the obstruction. Like reflection, diffraction is affected by the physical properties of the obstruction and the characteristics of the incident wave.
Indoor scenarios are often more complex, where numerous objects can scatter, diffract, reflect and absorb radiation. It is made more complicated by the movement of people, who rapidly change environments. The indoor environment is not stationary in both space and time. The ability to predict the behavior of signals in indoor environments is crucial. Therefore, there is a need to understand the signal behavior of these wireless systems.

# Four Maxwell equations

WiFi is an electromagnetic wave containing a signal: Internet data. Electromagnetic waves are well known to physicists and are governed by Maxwell's 4 equations, which give the solution for E, the electric field, and B, the magnetic field, in space and time. 

## First Maxwell equation

The first of the four equations is based on Gauss's law of electrostatics, which assures us that "when a surface is closed, the integral of the electric flux density is always equal to the charge enclosed on that surface", which we can express as the product of the electric flux density vector and the integral of the surface being equal to the enclosed charge:

## Second Maxwell equation

The second of the four equations is based on Gauss's law for the magnetic field or magnetostatics, which assures us that "on a closed surface, the integral of the magnetic flux density is always equal to the total scalar magnetic flux enclosed within that surface of any shape or size and in any medium".

## Third Maxwell equation

Maxwell's third equation is derived from Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that "whenever there are n turns of conducting coil in a time-varying magnetic field an alternating electromotive force is induced in each and every coil."

## Fourth Maxwell equation

Maxwell's fourth and final equation is based on Ampere's law which postulates that "the closed line integral of the magnetic field vector is always equal to the total amount of the scalar electric field enclosed in the path of any shape".

# Helmholtz equation

In the case of WiFi waves, we do not have to take time into account since, since the period of the signal is so short, the quality of the signal will not change with time. Since these are then stationary solutions, we can simplify Maxwell's equations into a single equation known as the Helmholtz Equation
